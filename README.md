# Loading 3rd Party Data in Nuxt 3 with Nuxt Scripts

> **Note**
> This repository contains the code for the YouTube Video [Loading Third Party Assets with Nuxt Scripts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjMqUUvH9AE).

In the video we cover how to load 3rd party data in Nuxt 3 using Nuxt Scripts. We use a [custom gist](https://gist.github.com/manniL/ea4b686400bc2951748636ce42f3c1f0) as script to load!
